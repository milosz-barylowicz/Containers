# Containers
Repository it my place to practice building project with:
 - Automated builds using Github workflows (building C++ project, running googletests, valgrind, sanitizers)
 - CMake build system

# Minimal requirements
 - CMake 3.24 installed [build project]
 - gcc 4.8 installed [sanitizers are included according to official Readme: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer]
